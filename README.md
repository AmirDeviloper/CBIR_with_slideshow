# 🎞️ Image Similarity & Slideshow Generator (Python)

> 🕒 **Note:** This project was originally developed in **May 2024** and uploaded to GitHub in **October 2025** for portfolio and documentation purposes.

This Python application analyzes a collection of images using **color histogram comparison** to identify visually similar ones. It then generates a **slideshow video** with customizable **transition effects** in various directions (left, right, up, down), creating a smooth and engaging visual experience.

The system includes:

- 🖼️ **Histogram-Based Matching** – Compare images based on color distribution  
- 🎞️ **Slideshow Builder** – Create ordered sequences of similar images  
- 🎬 **Video Generation** – Export final slideshow as a video file with transitions  
- 🎨 **Dataset Experience** – CBIR Used On CIFAR1000 Dataset  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Mixture** Can Extend Selection Similar Images Using ML Algorithms
